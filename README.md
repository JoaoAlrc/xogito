## Guidelines & Recomendations

The following are to be followed in several scenarios:

- We use naming conventions for branches stated in 'gitflow'. This means that we should follow the following naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bugfix-name>`
- Every feature or bugfix to be done needs to pass through a Pull Request or Merge Request first before merging and to be reviewed by at least other developer.
- **DO NOT** push any changes to the `package-lock.json` unless needed.
